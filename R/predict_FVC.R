#' Predict FVC based on Global Lungs Initiative
#'
#' This function computes predicted FVC from the ERS Global Lung Initiative function (Eur Resp J 2012 40:1324-43)
#'
#' @param age age in years (ages 25-95)
#' @param height height in centimeters
#' @param race 1=African American (AA), 2=North East Asian (NEA), 3=South East Asian (SEA) or 4=other (O)
#' @param sex 0=female/1=male
#' @param fvc measured FVC (optional). If provided, Z-score and percent predicted will be computed
#' @return vector of predicted FVC, coefficient of variation, skewness, lower limit normal,
#' Z-score (if fvc is provided), percent predicted FVC (if fvc is provided)
